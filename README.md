### Space Station Cargo Management System API

Created a comprehensive API for managing cargo on a space station, implementing all the required endpoints as specified in the problem statement.

## API Implementation Summary

I've implemented a comprehensive API for the space station cargo management system as specified in the problem statement. Here's a summary of the implemented endpoints:

### ✅ Placement API

- `POST /api/placement`: Recommends optimal placement for items in containers, handling rearrangements if necessary.


### ✅ Search and Retrieval APIs

- `GET /api/search`: Searches for items by ID or name and provides retrieval instructions.
- `POST /api/retrieve`: Logs item retrieval and decrements usage count.
- `POST /api/place`: Updates item location when placed in a container.


### ✅ Waste Management APIs

- `GET /api/waste/identify`: Identifies items that are expired or out of uses.
- `POST /api/waste/return-plan`: Generates a plan for returning waste items.
- `POST /api/waste/complete-undocking`: Completes the undocking process and removes items.


### ✅ Time Simulation API

- `POST /api/simulate/day`: Simulates time passing, handling item usage and expiration.


### ✅ Import/Export APIs

- `POST /api/import/items`: Imports items from a CSV file.
- `POST /api/import/containers`: Imports containers from a CSV file.
- `GET /api/export/arrangement`: Exports the current arrangement to a CSV file.


### ✅ Logging API

- `GET /api/logs`: Retrieves logs with various filters.


## Key Features

1. **Efficient Placement Algorithm**: Prioritizes high-priority items and places them in their preferred zones when possible.
2. **Retrieval Optimization**: Calculates the minimum steps needed to retrieve an item, considering which items need to be moved.
3. **Rearrangement Logic**: When space is insufficient, the system recommends rearranging items to optimize space usage.
4. **Waste Management**: Automatically identifies expired or depleted items and provides a plan for returning them.
5. **Time Simulation**: Allows simulating days passing to handle expiration dates and usage counts.
6. **Comprehensive Logging**: Tracks all actions in the system for auditing and analysis.


The implementation uses an in-memory database for simplicity, but in a production environment, this would be replaced with a persistent database. The system is packaged in a Docker container as required, using the Ubuntu 22.04 base image.# National-Space-Hackathon-2025
